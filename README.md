I basically made this on a whim. Just a simple little program that creates a gnome who hangs out on your taskbar.

The gnome will:
-Walk around
-Dance
-Sleep
-Throw rocks (Sometimes randomly aimed, sometimes aimed at your cursor.

Clicking on the gnome or a rock will throw the gnome or rock into the air.

If the gnome gets hit by a rock that is travelling fast enough, the gnome gets knocked out for a bit.

Why did I make this program? Because gnomes.
