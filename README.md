I basically made this on a whim. Just a simple little program that creates a gnome who hangs out on your taskbar.

The gnome will:

-Walk around

-Dance

-Sleep

-Throw rocks (Sometimes randomly aimed, sometimes aimed at your cursor)

Clicking on the gnome or a rock will throw the gnome or rock into the air.

If the gnome gets hit by a rock that is travelling fast enough, the gnome gets knocked out for a bit.

The program assumes Windows 10 is running with the taskbar which is 40 pixels high at the bottom. I have no real reason to make it dynamically adapt to the computer's actual taskbar layout, so if you are using anything other than a 40 pixel taskbar positioned at the bottom of your screen, you'll have to adjust the code accordingly.

Why did I make this program? Because gnomes.
